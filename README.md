# Javascript observer pattern (ES6)

### Learn javascript observer pattern through this example.

#### 1. Increment - button updates Observable/Subject and notifies subscribed observables that a change has been made.
#### 2. Add Observer Element of type non-input - button creates new element of type non-input (div) and subscribes it to Observable/Subject to be updated whenever a change happens.
#### 3. Add Observer Element of type input - button creates new element of type input with one way binding and subscribes it to Observable/Subject to be updated whenever a change happens.
#### 4. You can click on number displaying elements to unsubscribe from Observable/Subject.
#### 5. Inputs with red numbers are two way binding inputs, if you change value of it all other observables will be updated with the given value.
